In this task, I created a mobile-first application for my Portfolio

Used to complete this task is the Bootstrap CSS framework.

The following pages were created: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html

By using Bootstrap, the portfolio site was recreated with a navbar, a responsive layout and responsive images

On the 640px screen, contents took up the entire screen. On the 768 and 980 screens, some margins on the left and right sides of the screen were added to fit majority of the screen.
